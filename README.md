# Overview

The Intelligent Auto Insurance Fraud Detection System is a powerful AI-driven application designed to identify potential fraudulent insurance claims. By leveraging machine learning techniques and a robust preprocessing pipeline, this system provides accurate predictions to help mitigate fraud risks. Users can upload their own claim datasets or rely on a default dataset for fraud detection.

# Features
- AI-Powered Fraud Detection: Utilizes advanced machine learning models to predict the likelihood of fraud in insurance claims.
- Flexible Data Input: Accepts user-uploaded datasets or uses a built-in default dataset.
- Policy Number Lookup: Allows for single claim analysis by entering or selecting a policy number.
- Batch Processing: Processes entire datasets for comprehensive fraud detection.
- Adjustable Threshold: Fine-tune the fraud probability threshold to control sensitivity.
- Interactive Visualization: Presents results in an easily interpretable format with options to download predictions.
